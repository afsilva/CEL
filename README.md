my personal playground for android programming

It is my attempt to provide useful information about Red Hat's Openshift with this app. Yet this  project is not associated with Red Hat or
Openshift at all.

v1.1.2 branch

- I have modified the backend of this application so it extends an Activity, isntead of a ListActivity. The idea is to start adding new more resources in the app and eventually changing the 'text' based status of Openshift to an image.
- I have also created a new layout file to control the font format of the ListView.
- A small change where if there is an Open Issue in Openshift, instead of just showing (1), or (2), I have added the word "Issue" or "Issues" at the end of the string.
