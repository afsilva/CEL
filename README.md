my personal playground for android programming

It is my attempt to provide useful information about Red Hat's Openshift with this app. Yet this  project is not associated with Red Hat or
Openshift at all.

 master branch (current version, v1.4)

- app now supports alarm manager and checks against Openshift status API once an hour. It only alerts if there is an open issue.

v1.5 branch

- custom preferences so users can set up how often the app should check against Openshift status API.

v1.2 branch

- new icon shape
- updated code to make API call to openshift using JSON, instead of loading the HTML page and parsing that.
