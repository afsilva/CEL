CEL - Cloud Engine Light
===
my personal playground for android programming

It is my attempt to provide useful information about Red Hat's Openshift with this app. Yet this  project is not associated with Red Hat or
Openshift at all.

v1.2 branch

- new icon shape
- updated code to make API call to openshift using JSON, instead of loading the HTML page and parsing that.
